To Do:


-redirects - maybe filters not updating fast enough

- clear filter error, cannot read split of undefined.  DataParseHelpers/filterByDate line 6
- Download.js and SeriesFilterModal.js  need to be styled.  X is uses px instead of percentages.
- SeriesFilterModal.js -> should get approval on text
- useHistory redirects , or go to original page - maybe something with AWS
