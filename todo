To Do:

Chrome Autofill overwrites values on controlled components
- could make email unchangeable 
- paying users already paid with paypal email, so probably not going to change
- unpaid users, can just make a new account.
- could send a message to Sauti admin to change email

-redirects - maybe filters not updating fast enough

- clear filter error, cannot read split of undefined.  DataParseHelpers/filterByDate line 6
- Download.js and SeriesFilterModal.js  need to be styled.  X is uses px instead of percentages.
- SeriesFilterModal.js -> should get approval on text
- useHistory redirects , or go to original page - maybe something with AWS

Misspelling - border_crossing location : Loitokitok,  but commoditycountry: Loitoktok

exchange rate direction -> looks like an error , displaying only one currency

after sign in : TypeError: Cannot read property 'filter' of undefined

after signing up for an account.  When click on account, getting issues to view info.  Possibly not a column in tradersUsers table.


After noData modal -> 
TypeError: Cannot read property 'split' of undefined

refresh on bar graph

exchange rate direction should show arrow ->



Lance's notes
-More robust demographic data asssignment (right now it's checking the number of characters or it's checking the entire data string for a value - needs to look for specific keys)
-Border locations - Some of the locations look like 0. The data is coming in on the download button, but looks like an error on the graph
-Include the whole string for exchange rate direction & break out exchange rate direction
-Map data needs to be titled correctly when downloading
-Show saved data in "My Account"
