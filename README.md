## Project Overview

- [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/ycDN2Mzb/labs-14-sauti-databank)

- [Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/Feature-Canvas-All-charts-with-UX-design-in-Key-Trader-Demographics-tab-17e9fbd80c1b4a719c125d448491a400)

Sauti is a nonprofit that provides a platform for small traders in East African countries to look up realtime market data. Sauti also collects demographic data on these traders, but, until our Labs project, they didn't have a way to visualize that demographic data for researchers.

Using [React](https://reactjs.org/), the [react-dropdown library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dropdown), [Nivo](https://nivo.rocks/) (built for React data visualization, on top of d3js),and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) on the front-end, our team helped Sauti make its data more helpful and useful for economic researchers and policy makers.

### Key Features

A researcher interested in the Sauti Databank is able to see the following Key Demographic Data across all traders by selecting through a dropdown menu:
- Primary Language
- Country of Residence
- Age
- Cross-Border Trade as Primary Source of Income
- Primary Border Crossing
- Gender
- Education
- Border-Crossing Frequency

## Tech Stack

### Front-end built using:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): Currently industry standard for web applications, using React let us manage displaying large amounts of data effectively by implementing Components. 
- [react-dropdown library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dropdown): Helped us use an existing library for making the dropdown beautiful so that we could focus instead on the business logic and data that differentiates Sauti in the nonprofit space. 
- [Nivo](https://nivo.rocks/): Built specifically for React and ontop of d3js, Nivo provided the functionality we needed and thorough documentation to make it possible to complete our project within deadline. 
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/): A CSS compiler helped us iterate more quickly on styling with the efficient use of nesting. 

#### Front-end deployed to [Netlify](https://production-sauti-databank.netlify.com/).

#### [Back-end](https://github.com/sauti-databank/back-end) built using:

- Node.js
- Express
- KNEX
- MySQL

Read our back-end [documentation](https://github.com/sauti-databank/back-end/blob/master/README.md) for more on our reasoning behind choosing these tools. 

# APIs

## Authentication 

🚫Placeholder: Protected routes were not a priority for Sauti at the time of our first release (August 2019). 

# Testing

We tested the site in Chrome and Firefox thoroughly, and reported seven issues (and counting!) as Github Issues. 

# Installation Instructions

* After cloning or pulling repository for the first time, run "yarn install" in the app directory called /sauti.
* Run "yarn start" in /sauti directory to start react app.


## Other Scripts

* build - creates a build of the application
* test - runs tests in **tests** directory \* eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them

# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

## Issue/Bug Request

**If you are having an issue with the existing project code, please submit a bug report under the following guidelines:**

- Check first to see if your issue has already been reported.
- Check to see if the issue has recently been fixed by attempting to reproduce the issue using the latest master branch in the repository.
- Create a live example of the problem.
- Submit a detailed bug report including your environment & browser, steps to reproduce the issue, actual and expected outcomes, where you believe the issue is originating from, and any potential solutions you have considered.

### Feature Requests

We would love to hear from you about new features which would improve this app and further the aims of our project. Please provide as much detail and information as possible to show us why you think your new feature should be implemented.

### Pull Requests

If you have developed a patch, bug fix, or new feature that would improve this app, please submit a pull request. It is best to communicate your ideas with the developers first before investing a great deal of time into a pull request to ensure that it will mesh smoothly with the project.

Remember that this project is licensed under the MIT license, and by submitting a pull request, you agree that your work will be, too.

#### Pull Request Guidelines

- Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
- Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, including new plist variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
- Ensure that your code conforms to our existing code conventions and test coverage.
- Include the relevant issue number, if applicable.
- You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
