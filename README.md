## Project Overview

- [Labs 19 Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/2LXUKk9x/labs-19-sauti-data-bank)

- [Product Canvases](https://www.notion.so/e975f72982c24806a63b4a09840142d1?v=e2ba54cf176244d1b886672103bca454)

- [UX Design files](https://www.figma.com/file/8Mv2EXDnjjZoauqWfzZbsa/Sauti-Databank?node-id=108%3A9789)

Sauti is a nonprofit that provides a platform for small traders in East African countries to look up realtime market data. Sauti also collects demographic data on these traders, but, until our Labs project, they didn't have a way to visualize that demographic data for researchers.

Using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [react-dropdown library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dropdown), [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/), [Nivo](https://nivo.rocks/), and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) on the front-end, our team helped Sauti make its data more helpful and useful for economic researchers and policy makers.

### Key Features

A researcher interested in the Sauti Databank is able to see the following Key Demographic Data across all traders by selecting through a dropdown menu:

- Primary Language
- Country of Residence
- Age
- Cross-Border Trade as Primary Source of Income
- Primary Border Crossing
- Gender
- Education
- Border-Crossing Frequency
- Most Requested Procedures Commodity
- Most Requested Procedures Commodity Categories
- Requested Procedures for Destination (Imports to:)
- Most Requested Documents Information for Procedures
- Most Requested Agency Information for Procedures
- Origin of Traders' Goods
- Final Destination Country
- Final Destination Market
- Top Commodity
- Top Commodity Categories
- Exchange Rate Direction

## Tech Stack

### Front-end built using:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): Currently industry standard for web applications, using React let us manage displaying large amounts of data effectively by implementing Components.
- [react-dropdown library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dropdown): Helped us use an existing library for making the dropdown beautiful so that we could focus instead on the business logic and data that differentiates Sauti in the nonprofit space.
- [Nivo](https://nivo.rocks/): Built specifically for React and ontop of d3js, Nivo provides easily-used graph functionality to display accurate dipiction of the data being analyzed.
- [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/): Built to interact with GraphQL backend API's well, Apollo is the platform that enables us to write queries that specify back-end requests which retreives data for smooth transitions in crossfiltration. We utilize Apollo-Boost wrapper for easy interaction between React front-end components and GraphQL back-end. 
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/): A CSS compiler helped us iterate more quickly on styling with the efficient use of nesting.

#### Front-end deployed to [Netlify](https://sauti.now.sh/).

#### [Back-end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/sauti-databank-be) built using:

- Node.js
- Express
- Knex
- GraphQL
- MySQL
- Jest

Our reasoning behind using the above tools for the back-end build is to make cross-filtering easy and efficient. Alongside Node and Express for operation set up, we are using the GraphQL framework which is a query manipulation language that requests specific data from the database using one single API endpoint.

# APIs

Please see Back-end documentation [here](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/sauti-databank-be/blob/master/README.md).


# Testing

We tested the site in Chrome and Firefox using Jest.
